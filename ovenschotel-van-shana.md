Shana's Pork & Carrot Ovenschotel (Casserole)
===============================================

## Ingredients

- 4-5 large baking potatoes, peeled and cut into large chunks
- 1 bag of baby carrots, finely chopped (<5mm pieces)
- 0.5kg minced pork
- butter (the real stuff)
- milk
- sugar
- ground nutmeg
- thyme
- salt
- pepper

## Instructions

# 0. Preparation

Preheat the oven to 200–250°C (roughly 455°F).

# 1. Meat

In a pan over medium heat, cook the ground pork thoroughly in a spoon of butter. Spice with thyme to taste. Once cooked, set aside in the base of an oven dish.

# 2. Carrots

In a pot, cook the finely chopped carrots with approximately 20ml water. Add a couple of spoons of sugar. Cover the pot and allow to cook until the carrots are sweet and soft. When ready, layer the carrots over top of the meat in the oven dish. Pour some of the remaining carrot juice over the whole thing.

# 3. Mashed Potatoes

Cover the potato chunks with water in a large pot and bring to a boil. Allow to boil for roughly 20 minutes, or until they are soft in the center when stabbed with a fork. Once ready, drain the pot and shake the potatoes around so that they soften and begin to break apart. Using a stamper (masher), mash the potatoes. Add a spoon of butter periodically until you reach the desired texture & flavor. Use a couple of spoons of milk to give it a velvety texture. Mix in a couple of spoons of ground nutmeg, as well as salt and pepper to taste. Add to the dish atop the carrots, until the dish is full to the edge.

# 4. Bake

Use a fork to create ridges across the potatoes. Season with more pepper to taste. Once the oven has reached the ideal temperature, place the dish inside and bake it for 10–15 minutes, or until the potatoes have become golden brown on top.
