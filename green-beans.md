Lauren's Green Beans
===============================================

## Ingredients

- 2 lbs. fresh green beans
- 1–2 thick slices fresh pancetta
- 3–4 cloves of fresh garlic
- 1 tbsp. unsalted sweet cream butter
- Juice of 1 fresh lemon
- Fresh-ground black pepper

## Instructions

# 0. Preparation

Dice the pancetta into small cubes. Squeeze juice from the lemon into a small bowl to use later. Mince the garlic into tiny pieces.

# 1. Parboil the Green Beans

In a large pot of heavily-salted water, heat the green beans until the water is a rolling boil. Allow to boil for 2 minutes or until the green beans are a bright green color. Then drain the beans in a collander, and shock them with cold water to prevent them from cooking further.

# 2. Sautée the Garlic and Pancetta

i. In a very large cast-iron skillet, melt the butter over medium heat and use it to sautée the garlic until it is golden brown in color. 
ii. Add in the pancetta cubes and cook them over medium heat in the butter & garlic mixture. The fat from the pancetta should mix with the butter.
iii. Cook the green beans for 5–10 minutes, making sure they are thoroughly coated in the butter & fat mixture from the pancetta. Add pepper to taste.
iv. Set heat to low and gradually add in lemon juice. Continue tossing the green beans around until they are well-coated.
v. Once the green beans begin to blacken slightly on the outside, they are done. Remove from the fire and let cool.

# 3. Enjoy!
