# Stroopwafels

## Ingredients

### Waffle Cookie

* 4 cups all-purpose flour
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar
* 1 cup unsalted butter
* 2 large eggs
* 1 (1/4 ounce) package active dry yeast
* 1/2 cup warm water

### Filling

* 1 1/2 cups packed brown sugar
* 1 cup unsalted butter
* 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 6 tablespoons dark corn syrup

## Directions

1. Preheat a shallow waffle iron.
2. To Make Waffles: Dissolve the yeast in the warm water. Cut butter into the flour. Mix in the sugar, cinnamon, eggs and yeast mixture. Mix well and set aside for 30 to 60 minutes.
3. Roll dough into 12 small balls. Squeeze each ball into the preheated pizzelle iron and bake for about 30 seconds. Cut the waffles into two thin waffles and spread with filling.
4. To Make Filling: In a saucepan, boil the brown sugar, the remaining one cup of the butter, cinnamon (this is a must have ingredient) and dark corn syrup until it reaches the soft ball stage (234-240 F, 112-115 C), stirring constantly.
5. To Assemble: Cut each waffle into 2 thin waffles and spread the filling. Repeat this process until all filling if gone.
6. Makes 12 servings. Best if eaten after theyâ€™ve cooled, less mess that way!
